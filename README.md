# smart-mirror
The code to accompany my Instructable on building a motion sensing smart mirror.

A few points to note:
1. I have placed a few variables at the top that you need to review and change for your own uses (eg the calendar api etc).
2. The code was produced initially for my own personal use, so I make no claims as to its quality or "cleanliness", and I won't be trying to justify it to anyone.
3. It's not "production-ready" - of course it works for my own purposes but I would clean it up, restructure it and add all sorts of error trapping if I was to write this for an actual website.
4. I don't provide any support for the code, it is provided as-is, please use as you see fit.  I'd be grateful if you would leave the line giving my details at the top though as a means of providing credit (as I have with the sources below).


Some credits:

// weather plugin from http://simpleweatherjs.com/

// example calendar API code from: https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/js#prerequisites

// date format from: http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/date-time-format

(Very) basic usage:

- Put all the files in same folder on root of localhost site
- Create an API key on the Google Calendar API website, specifying what hosts to allow the connection from (either "localhost" or a virtual directory you created on your web server on the tablet)
- Replace all the variables at the top with your own details (calendar ID, location city for weather etc)
- First time the code runs, it will prompt you to click "authorise" to allow the localhost site to access your Google data, subsequently it will work straight away.
